Hardware Setup Complete Guide:

1. Connect ESP32 to Computer
   - Connect the ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable
   - Ensure the board has power and is recognized by the computer

2. Open Arduino IDE
   - Manually open the Arduino IDE application
   - If you don't have it installed, download from arduino.cc

3. Open Firmware File
   - In Arduino IDE: File > Open
   - Navigate to: hardware/arduino_code/ecosync_firmware/ecosync_firmware.ino
   - Open the file

4. Configure Board Settings
   - Tools > Board: Select 'ESP32 Dev Module'
   - Tools > Port: Select 'COM14 (Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge)'

5. Upload Firmware
   - Click the Upload button (right arrow icon)
   - Wait for the upload to complete (may take 1-2 minutes)

6. Monitor Output
   - After upload, open Serial Monitor: Tools > Serial Monitor
   - Set baud rate to 115200
   - You should see sensor data and LCD initialization messages

7. Verify LCD Display
   - The LCD should display:
     Row 1: T: XX°C  G: XXX
     Row 2: H: XX%
   - If no LCD is found, check I2C connections

8. Troubleshooting
   - If upload fails: Check USB connection and try different COM port
   - If LCD not found: Check I2C wiring (SDA=21, SCL=22)
   - If sensors not working: Check sensor connections
