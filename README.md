# EcoSync S4: Intelligent Environmental Monitoring System 🌍
> **A Next-Gen IoT Platform for Real-Time Air Quality & Environmental Tracking**

![Project Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x400/0f172a/22d3ee?text=EcoSync+S4+Dashboard)

## 🚀 Overview
**EcoSync S4** is a demonstration of a modern, scalable IoT architecture designed to bridge the gap between low-cost hardware and enterprise-grade environmental analysis. Unlike traditional student projects that simply display sensor values, EcoSync S4 implements a **Dual-Tier SaaS Architecture**, **AI-Driven Predictive Analytics**, and **Sensor Fusion** algorithms to provide actionable insights.

This repository contains the complete source code for:
*   **Hardware**: ESP32 Firmware (C++) with HTTP Handshake & OLED Feedback.
*   **Backend**: Python FastAPI with Sensor Fusion Engine & Google Gemini AI.
*   **Frontend**: React + Vite Dashboard with Glassmorphism UI & PWA support.

## 🌟 Key Features ("Top Notch")

### 1. Dual-Tier SaaS Architecture
Demonstrates a real-world business model within a technical project.
*   **LITE Tier (Free)**: Access to public environmental data and basic dashboard.
*   **PRO Tier (Research)**: Unlocks **AI Assistant**, **Historical Analytics**, **Predictive Mapping**, and **Sensor Fusion**.

### 2. Advanced Sensor Fusion (Kalman Filter)
Low-cost sensors (DHT11/MQ-135) are often noisy. We implemented a **Kalman Filter** algorithm on the backend to:
*   Fuse local sensor data with external API data (OpenMeteo).
*   Mathematically smoothen erratic readings.
*   Fill in data gaps seamlessly if a sensor disconnects.

### 3. AI Safety Officer (Google Gemini)
*   The system doesn't just show "CO2: 400ppm".
*   It analyzes the combination of Temp+Humidity+Gas using **Google Gemini AI**.
*   **Result**: "High Humidity + High Temp = Mold Risk. Suggest ventilation."

### 4. Hardware "Handshake" Protocol
*   Bi-directional communication verification.
*   The ESP32 sends data and **waits for a 200 OK** from the server.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Green LED blinks 3 times ONLY if the server accepts the data.
