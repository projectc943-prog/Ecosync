# IoT System User Manual

This guide walks you through using the Environmental Monitoring System from start to finish.

## 1. Getting Started: Account Creation
The system uses a secure Two-Step Verification process.

1.  **Sign Up (Email)**:
    *   Enter your Email Address on the Login Page.
    *   Click taking you to the OTP screen.
    *   *Note*: In the demo version, the specific 6-digit code is simulated in the backend logs or email stub.
2.  **Verify & Set Password**:
    *   Enter the 6-digit OTP.
    *   Enter your Full Name and desired Password.
    *   Click "Complete Registration".
3.  **Login**:
    *   Use your Email and Password to access the Dashboard.

## 2. The Dashboard (Home)
Once logged in, you will see the **Lite Mode** dashboard by default.
*   **Environmental Pulse**: A radar chart showing overall system health (PM2.5, Temp, Humidity, Signal).
*   **Live Tiles**: Real-time readings for Temperature, Humidity, and Air Quality.
*   **Trust Score**: A percentage indicating how reliable the sensor data is (based on signal stability).

## 3. Operations Mode (Lite)
For field operations or direct device connection:
*   Scroll to the bottom of the Dashboard.
*   **Device Connection Setup**:
    *   Enter ESP32 IP Address (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).
    *   Enter WiFi SSID.
    *   Click **Connect**.
*   The system will attempt to handshake directly with the hardware.

## 4. Pro Mode (Advanced Analytics)
Toggle the **"PRO"** switch in the sidebar to unlock advanced features.
*   **Sensor Fusion**: See how local data is merged with OpenWeatherMap data (Kalman Filter).
*   **AI Safety Officer**: Real-time health precautions generated by Google Gemini AI (e.g., "High UV detected, wear sunscreen").
*   **Predictive Graphs**: View temperature forecasts for the next 10 minutes.

## 5. Profile & Settings
Click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the sidebar.
*   **Sensor Calibration**:
    *   Adjust thresholds for Temperature Alerts (Max Temp).
    *   Adjust Vibration Sensitivity.
*   **Alert Configuration**:
    *   Enable/Disable Email or SMS notifications.
*   **System Layout**:
    *   Toggle "Voice Feedback" (JARVIS Mode).
    *   Switch to "High Performance Mode".
*   Click **Save Configuration** to sync these settings to the Cloud Backend.

## 6. Troubleshooting
*   **"Failed to Fetch"**: Ensure the backend server is running (`python3 scripts/start.py`).
*   **Data not updating**: Check if the device IP is correct in Lite Mode settings.
